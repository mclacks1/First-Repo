Week 1:
  1. We learned what tools are needed to develop a website.
  2. Markdown is a markup language used to make formatting text super easy to read, write, and share
  3. Markdown is a simplified version of HTML

  I am so excited to begin this adventure on mastering new a skill. It's something that drives me toward success. I enjoy the thrill of learning how to investigate and experiment with the blueprint of how to code websites.  Web development is very new to me, but I've always had a passion to explore technology. I am so honored to be given this opportunity to make my dream become reality. At the end of every week I will write out a summary of at least three major topics that we covered. The summary will provide me with notes and comments to myself, so that as I navigate on my tech journey I can perform a brief synposis of the course materials.

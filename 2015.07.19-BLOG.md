Week 5: 
We went on our first company visit to Drifty better known as Iconic. The speakers held presentations that we were very detailed and walked us through the step by step process of how coding will be applied to using the iconic software to develop mobile applications. It was very surreal to go in the office to see what the work environment looks and feel like in the tech world. Right now we are in Chapter 3 and  I am must say I am enjoying the knowledge that I am part taking in. HMTL and CSS is great and I like the way code school breaks down each element of the codes being used. I look forward to class each day of the work week and I can not wait to be placed in my interniship.

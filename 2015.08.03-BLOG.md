Week 7:

This week started off great and it ended with me being in such an uneasy place. God has blessed with an opportunity to work for one of the best companies in Madison. But I feel like I'm always faced with difficult issues where I have to stretch myself thin. I feel torn because I am three weeks away from graduating from this course and I feel overwhelmed and withdrawn. I am trying my hardest to remain positive especially since I am right at the end. For some reason I have the tendency when I get to the end where I am going to complete something important to me, I get distracted by personal issues. This seems to be the pattern since I've had my son. I just want to break this repetitive cycle that I constantly find myself in. I will continue this course and I have to get in work mode because it's now or never. I have to do this for myself and my son, so that I can create that driven mentality that sets up  for success because I will stop at nothing until I am successful.

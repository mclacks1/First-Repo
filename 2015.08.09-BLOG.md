Week 8: 

I started a new job this week and I am very happy about that because it pays well. But class is very overwhelming with so many different projects and assigments. I am trying my hardest to keep up with everything that is due and stay focused. I truly appreciate everyone that I have meet especially Rafa who helps me whenever I have question or don't quite understand the nature of the assignment. He literally breaks it down piece by piece to help me understand what I am doing. Latisha is another helpful person who is very resourceful and always telling about things that can help me become more self-sufficient.I am very happy that I choose to attend this course it has truly opened up doors for me and allowed my light to shine so that I can make important connections.

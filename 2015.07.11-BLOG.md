 Week 4:

  Today is Saturday, July 11, 2015 and we have officially finished out 4th week of class. We are on working on Chapter 3 this upcoming week. I attended the UX Conference o Friday, July 10, 2015 that took place at the Overture Center in Downtown Madison, WI. That was my first time at at the Overture Center and I have been in Madison for 12 years. It was such a great learning experience to hear from so many developers that had different views on techniques that use to be a invent and enhance technologies. Each speaker was very unique, but my favorite were the meeper bots. The developers were absolutely the most intriguing because it was so authetic and raw products. It's also added plus that my son is a car lover. I enjoyed the speaker who spoke about the children of today cling so closely totechnology to express themselves. This is such an expressive and creative children that is always looking for ways to perfect the way of world. I enjoyed the conference and I know this suppose to be the last one in Madison, but I hope they bring something similar back becuase it was very informational and fun.

Week 2: 

  This week went by extremely fast, I took in a lot of information and it seems to all be coming together. This class is most definitely what you make out of it. You have to come with an open free mind. I enjoy being around so many people that are hungry for the same type of knowledge I crave. We all get along very well and that is essential, especially since we work so closely with each other. As of right now we are on chapter 2 in the workbook were learning Javascript. This is a very new environment for me and I am still filling in the gaps of things I don't understand. Every morning I tell myself that one day you will be a master at this language. A wise saying is that practice makes perfect and I truly believe the more I indulge in expertimenting with this type of data I will be a master at it, somethings just take time.

Today is Friday and we are doing our first workshop as a class. It is a scrum board and it is project that we are working on with a client to create a website for people who have and love dogs and want to "meet" other dog lovers. We have created the logo, website name, and the tag line. This is really exciting because it is actually a real feel of what our work environment will be looking like. It feels great to get away from the coding for a while and do some real life work experience. The scrum workshop has given me the opportunity to open up and feel more comfortable with my classmates. The scrum board consist of gathering ideas from the client to create a functional website that meets the client and consumers needs. We all have an individual position that has to fulifull a certain requirement to contribute to the group as a whole. This week has been a true turning point and great bonding moments where I have  gained more knowledge from classmates from working together.

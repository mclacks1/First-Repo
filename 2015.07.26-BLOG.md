Week 6:

Today is Sunday, July 26, 2015 and we are in week 6 of the second cohort. I am very happy that I am learining how to use code  to create my very own website. We are getting more in depth with the bones of website development of the types of elements and tags that are needed. This is most defintely challenging and I enjoy every moment of the of it because in the end I will be extremely victorious. This developer world is still new to me and the language is fresh in my mind as well. As I go through tough challenges with grasping the new concepts I will remain positive and just continue to give more time outside of class to understand my materials. Six down down 5 more to goooo!!!!
